<h1>Brandon's Favorite Movies List</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>I can remember watching this movie on accident.  I had know idea what the story was about but I decided to take rish and it was worth it.  Leo Dicaprio is absolutely amazing in this movie and it's one of my favorite movies to rewatch</p>

<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>My favorite comedy of all time.  I can remember watching this as a kid (too young in todays age)and I was immediately addicted.  I watched this movie at least 5 times in a day.  I can remember my mother banning me from watching the movie because I was addicted.</p>

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Phenominal acting combined with an inspiring story.  This is one of my favorite background movies.  It's amazing how well the movie covers so many important events in history.</p>
